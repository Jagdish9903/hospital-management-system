# Doctor Deletion with Appointment Cancellation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds functionality to automatically cancel all scheduled appointments when a doctor is deleted from the admin dashboard. The cancellation includes a specific reason: "Doctor is no longer available".

## Backend Changes

### 1. AppointmentRepository.java
- **Added method**: `findScheduledAppointmentsByDoctorId(Long doctorId)`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all scheduled (non-cancelled) appointments for a specific doctor
- **Query**: `SELECT a FROM Appointment a WHERE a.doctor.id = :doctorId AND a.status = 'SCHEDULED' AND a.deletedAt IS NULL`

### 2. AppointmentService.java
- **Added method**: `cancelAllAppointmentsForDoctor(Long doctorId, String reason)`
- **Purpose**: Cancels all scheduled appointments for a doctor with a specific reason
- **Features**:
  - Frees up associated doctor slots (sets status to AVAILABLE)
  - Sets appointment status to CANCELLED
  - Sets cancellation reason and timestamp
  - Sets cancelledByDoctor to the doctor's ID
  - Returns count of cancelled appointments
  - Handles errors gracefully (continues with other appointments if one fails)

### 3. DoctorService.java
- **Modified method**: `deleteDoctor(Long id)` → now returns `Map<String, Object>`
- **New functionality**:
  - Calls `cancelAllAppointmentsForDoctor()` before deleting the doctor
  - Returns detailed information including:
    - Doctor ID and name
    - Number of cancelled appointments
    - Success message
- **Added dependency**: `AppointmentService` injection

### 4. Controllers Updated
- **AdminDoctorController.java**: Updated `deleteDoctor()` to handle new return type
- **DoctorController.java**: Updated `deleteDoctor()` to handle new return type
- **Return type changed**: `ApiResponse<Void>` → `ApiResponse<Map<String, Object>>`

## Frontend Changes

### 1. AdminDoctorsComponent.ts
- **Modified method**: `confirmDelete()`
- **New functionality**:
  - Extracts cancellation information from API response
  - Shows different success messages based on number of cancelled appointments
  - Displays doctor name and appointment count in success toast
  - Handles both cases: with and without cancelled appointments

## API Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Doctor deleted successfully and 3 appointments cancelled",
  "data": {
    "doctorId": 123,
    "doctorName": "Dr. John Doe",
    "cancelledAppointments": 3,
    "message": "Doctor deleted successfully and 3 appointments cancelled"
  }
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Cancellation**: All scheduled appointments are automatically cancelled when a doctor is deleted
2. **Proper Slot Management**: Doctor slots are freed up and made available for other appointments
3. **Audit Trail**: Cancellation includes proper timestamps and reason tracking
4. **User Feedback**: Frontend shows detailed success message with cancellation count
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of individual appointment cancellation failures
6. **Consistent Reason**: All cancellations use the same reason: "Doctor is no longer available"

## Testing

A comprehensive test file `test-doctor-deletion-with-appointments.html` has been created to verify:
1. Doctor creation
2. Appointment creation for the doctor
3. Doctor deletion
4. Verification that appointments are cancelled with correct reason

## Database Impact

- **Appointments table**: Status changed to 'CANCELLED', cancellation_reason set, cancelled_at timestamp added
- **Doctor_slots table**: Status changed to 'AVAILABLE' for freed slots
- **No data loss**: All appointment data is preserved, just marked as cancelled

## Security Considerations

- Only admin users can delete doctors (existing `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` annotation)
- Cancellation is performed by the system, not by individual users
- All operations are logged and auditable

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing appointment cancellation functionality remains unchanged
- Doctor deletion API response format changed but includes all necessary information
- Frontend gracefully handles both old and new response formats
